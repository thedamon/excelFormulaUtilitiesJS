# excelFormulaUtilitiesJS
Based on ewbi's go calc excel formula parser http://ewbi.blogs.com/develops/popular/excelformulaparsing.html. This library contains methods to beautify an excel formula.  This library also contains functions to convert an excel formula to JavaScript (ECMAScript) or C#.

FORK: Taking the original version and making it so you can set an array of formulas and it will output them all.. possibly to new files.
